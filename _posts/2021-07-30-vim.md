I recently was listening to "The Changelog" podcast and the episode featured lots of developers talking about why they love vim. This got me thinking about my own reasons. One of my favourite features of vim is the vim's visual mode that allows you to highlight and manipulate text. I usually use this mode to fix the spacing or to insert text.
