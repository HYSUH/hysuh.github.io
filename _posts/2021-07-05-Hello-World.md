Logo was the first programming language that I ever learnt when I was in the 4th grade. I was really happy to find that python had its own logo module that I then used to create my github profile picture

The code is located [here](https://github.com/HYSUH/notghst/blob/master/logoGenerator.py)

It uses the [python Turtle graphics module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).
